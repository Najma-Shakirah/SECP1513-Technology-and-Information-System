<h2>Reflection</h2>
This course has helped me learn the fundamentals of electronic circuits and how to manipulate them. I think the knowledge I gained by learning the underlying hardware of digital systems can help me write more optimized and efficient code. Things that I could improve are to do more circuit simulations using Deeds and exercises to further understand the subject.
